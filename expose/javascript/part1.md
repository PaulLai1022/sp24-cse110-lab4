part1:

question1: 
20 because line 9 contains a return statement without a value following it. This will cause the function to exit early without returning anything if the add parameter is false. As a result, the console.log('2:', result); statement will not be executed because the function has already returned.

question2: 
20 because line 13 contains a console.log('2:', result); statement. However, this statement is outside of the else block due to incorrect indentation. This means that it will be executed regardless of whether the add parameter is true or false.

question3:
20 because the let variable result is defined within this block so 10+10 = 20, and the add inputted as true. so the result is 20

question4:
syntax error becuase the let variable result is not defined within this scope hence the variable it undefined.

question5:
error, because result is const and we try to modify it at line 9, cause the error at the console log statement.


question6:
error, because result is const and we try to modify it at line 9, cause the error at the console log statement.
