question1:
3, discountPrices function calculates the discounted prices for each item in the array [100, 200, 300] with a discount of 0.5 (50% discount) and it round the prices into two decimal places by round method, which return 3 at the end. 

question2:
150, discountPrices function is called with arguments [100, 200, 300] and 0.5.
Inside the function, the for loop iterates over each price in the prices array.
for each price,the discounted prices will be calculated in store in discounted array.
300 will be the last item in the prices array in this case, 300*0.5 = 150

question3:
the statement will print the final rounded discounted price of the last item in the prices array. it's 300 in this case, 300*0.5 = 150

question4:
the funtion will return a array containing the discounted prices items in prices array. In this case [50, 100, 150]

question5:
Since i is declared using let inside the for loop, it is not accessible outside the loop. If you try to log i outside the loop, it will result in a ReferenceError.

question6: 
The variable discountedPrice is defined inside the for loop, so it's not accessible outside of the loop, which will result in ReferenceError when return

question7:
finalPrice is defined inside the for loop, so it's not accessible outside of the loop, which will result in ReferenceError when return


question8:
[ 50, 100, 150 ], The function discountedPrices will return an array [50, 100, 150], which are the discounted prices for each item in the input array [100, 200, 300] with a discount rate of 0.5.

question9:
console.log(i) will cause an error because i is declared using let inside the for loop, making it block-scoped to the loop. which result in reference error

question10:
In this code, console.log(length) will print the length of the prices array, which is 3 in this case becasue of ([100, 200, 300]). Because we have stored the length of the prices array in a constant length length. 

quetsion11:

[ 50, 100, 150 ],  the funtion will return an array containing the discounted prices of the items in the prices array.
